# Experiment-2: State Management Using Redux (Counter Application)

## Aim

To implement centralized state management using Redux in a React application.

## Software Requirements

- Node.js
- React
- Redux Toolkit

## Theory

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It stores the application state in a single global store and updates it using actions and reducers. Redux Toolkit simplifies Redux implementation by reducing boilerplate code.

## Procedure

1. Install Redux Toolkit and React-Redux.
2. Create a Redux store.
3. Define a slice with actions and reducers.
4. Provide the store to the application.
5. Access and update state using hooks.

## What I added

- A beginner-friendly Redux counter in `App.jsx` using `@reduxjs/toolkit` and `react-redux`.
- Simple styles in `index.css` with improved buttons and layout.
- A `reset` action to reset the counter to zero.

## Run

Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
cd Experiment_4/4.2
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5174/ (or the port shown by Vite).
